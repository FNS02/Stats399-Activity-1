# Ideas for graphic:  
Generate a graphic from the data of a sentiment analysis  generated by the students of the University of Auckland Statistics Capstone Course (Stats399).

## Option 1
1. Use only the first list from the question, "Write down four words to describe how you're feeling about this course. Separate your four words by commas."
2. 4 words and split them depending on if they're negative/postive.
3. Create a world cloud and colour code them red for negative, green/yellow for positive.
4. Write a summary of the interpretation of the data. 

## Option 2
Sunday deadline to switch to easier option.  
  1. 4 words personal opinion and one for the rest of the group.
  2. See how similar 4 words and the rest of the group are.
  3. Split into positive or negative sections. Compare the two questions with a bar plot.
