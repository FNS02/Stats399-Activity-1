# Stats399: Activity 1
This repo holds the R-Code files and graphics that pertain to the Stats399 Activity 1 in 2024 from the University of Auckland 

This activity focuses on building a sentiment analysis from a set of data generated by the students of the University of Auckland Statistics Capstone Course (Stats399). 

## Task Outline
With your team, submit the following items by your notified deadline.

An informative, attractive **graphic** that opens with standard software and displays on a single screen (e.g. PDF, PNG, JPG)
The **CSV of cleaned data** you used; a **code file** (probably an R file); and a **README file** (a text document with reproducible instructions)
Name all files with your team-name: e.g. Kaka-A-Graphic.pdf, Kaka-A-CleanData.csv, Kaka-A-Code.R, Kaka-A-README.txt.
You should spend a total of 6 to 7 hours outside of class on this activity. You can choose how to divide this time between team meetings and individual contributions.

You can use as much or as little of the data as you like: you don't have to include everything in your graphic.
